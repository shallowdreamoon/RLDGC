# Neighborhood Consensus-guided Reinforcement Learning for Scalable Deep Graph Clustering

This is a Pytorch implementation of Neighborhood Consensus-guided Reinforcement Learning for Scalable Deep Graph Clustering (RLDGC)

### Brief Description

Cora dataset and ACM dataset are taken as examples to demonstrate in the code. 

### Requirements

* Pytorch 1.9
* python 3.6
* numpy
* network 2.3
* scipy 1.5
* scikit-learn 0.22

### Running
(Before running, pre-training is first performed and the corresponding generated files are saved in the pretrain_res dictionary.)

For Cora dataset: 
```
python train_cora.py
```


For ACM dataset: 
```
python train_ACM.py
```

### Evaluation Results

All optimal results of the model are in the results dictionary.



```python

```
